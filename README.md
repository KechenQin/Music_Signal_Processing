# Music_Signal_Processing

This is the final project of Scientific Data Processing in Matlab. I and my friend Liangwei Guo designed an interesting music processing application and we both got A+ in this course.

This application includes many useful functions, such as vocal elimination and pitch adjusting. The most amazing part is that we implemented a notes recognition function, which means that this application can identify notes in a small piece of music/humans' voice. We used Fourier transform and short time energy to implement this function and got a good result for single track file.
